<img style="width: 4.5%; float: left; margin-top: 1.3%;" src="/assets/img/blackstar.svg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm <strong>Manish</strong>, an <strong>IIT Bombay</strong> graduate and a self-taught
<strong>Data Scientist</strong>. I have been doing research in the field of drug discovery
using AI by combining my knowledge in Chemical Engineering from B.Tech and passion for
AI. With more than two year of industry experience, I am inclined towards a research career
in the field of AI. <br>In my spare time, I read books, I write code, I
play video games, and I travel around to explore the nature. Take a look at some
of the clicks from my travel diary.
