<p style="text-align: justify">The coronavirus pandemic has caused enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The entire research community is working tirelessly for a vaccine but it could take upto few years before there's any solution available.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">COVID-19 research browser is aimed to help researchers navigate this fast-growing body of coronavirus literature to efficiently find relevant and up-to-date information. It's a search tool that can search among thousands of publications, authors, journals and show the relevant research.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I worked on this full-stack project, from setting up the backend for data storage to a server deployed <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">reactjs</span> powered front-end app.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I also worked on another version of this project where the research papers were not limited to covid-19. This search engine included over 48 million papers, nearly 68 million authors and over 50 thousand journals and yet the results could be fetched in less than a second. Another version included over 208 million papers, nearly 253 million authors and over 60 thousand journals, basically covering almost every paper written since the year 1800.</p>
