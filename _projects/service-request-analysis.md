<p style="text-align: justify">The problem statement was that the project clients were receiving hundreds of emails from their product customers every day and redirecting them to respective divisions within the company required significant time and manpower. This project was related to the classification of those emails into <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">70+</span> categories and redirecting them to the concerned divisions in real-time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I established deep learning frameworks like <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Self-Attention Networks</span>, <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Recurrent Neural Networks</span>, <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Long-Short Term Memory</span> and <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Gated Recurrent Unit Networks</span> along with setting up the backend <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Postgres</span> database for data storage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Automation of this process saved hundreds of work-hours for the client weekly.</p>
