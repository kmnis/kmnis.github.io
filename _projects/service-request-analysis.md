<p style="text-align: justify">Any large organization often receives hundreds, probably thousands, of emails everyday from their customers and redirecting them to respective divisions within the company can require significant time and manpower. An automatic classification of these emails into several categories in order to redirect them to repective divisions can help save the time as well money resources.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I built deep learning models using architectures like Self-Attention Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long-Short Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit Networks along with setting up the backend Postgres database for data storage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The implementation code is propriety property of <a href="aganitha.ai" target="_blank">Aganitha Cognitive Solutions</a>.</p>

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify">Automation of this process saved hundreds of work-hours for the client weekly.</p> -->
