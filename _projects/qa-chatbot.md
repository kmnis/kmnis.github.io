<p style="text-align: justify">To any customer-oriented organization, a large number of queries from customers are often repetitive and can be answered by an automatic chatbot machine. This not only saves the time but also manpower needed for the task.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I first built a deep learning model to generate proper English sentences and then a Chatbot on top of it to answer common queries by customers. I also developed pipelines to improve text search algorithms in a website by added support for context-sensitive search using Natural Language Processing techniques.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The implementation code is propriety property of <a href="http://www.globalgrowthioc.com/" target="_blank">Enterprise Growth Accelerator</a>, formerly known as Eli Research India.</p>
