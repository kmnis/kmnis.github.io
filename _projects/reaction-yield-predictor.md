<p style="text-align: justify">After getting the right products for a chemical reaction, chemists need to know how much of a product will form. Getting the actual yield of a reaction is needed for drug synthesis planning and is quite advantageous to decide on whether a synthesis path is to be preferred or avoided.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">This project was related to predicting the yield of a chemical reaction given the actual product. This was an 11 month long, end-to-end project which included tasks from acquiring and cleaning data from various sources to deploying deep learning models on servers for client usage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">With nearly <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">500+</span> machine learning and deep learning models trained, this project required steps from featurizing chemical molecules into numerical vectors to performing quantum computations.</p>
