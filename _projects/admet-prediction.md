<p style="text-align: justify">According to a <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/galaxy-drug-candidates" target="_blank">report</a> by Harvard Medical School, as many as 90 percent of promising drug candidates fail before or during human clinical trials, falling into the so-called "valley of death". The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that it takes an average of $2.6 billion and more than 10 years for a new medicine to hit the market.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Beforehand knowledge of pharmacokinetic properties like Absorption(A) coefficient, Distribution coefficient(D), Metabolism rate(M), Excretion rate(E), Toxicity(T) and Bioavailability for potential drugs in drug discovery trials can save a significant amount of time and money resources for researchers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I developed different variations of Graph Convolutional Networks like
<span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Gated network</span>, <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Attention network</span> and <span style="color: #bf616a; background-color: #f9f9f9">Gated-Augmented-Attention Networks(GAGCNs)</span> for thr task. The models were able to distinguish between drugs with higher and lower values of properties like Bioavailability.</p>
