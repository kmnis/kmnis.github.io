<p style="text-align: justify">Chemical and medical experimental data storage pipelines often struggle with uniformity and standardization across different teams and labs. With a large number of experiments being carried out, it can become increasingly tough to replicate and keeping track of the results.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I explored different pipelines used by large pharma companies and developed a graph-based data model to store the experimental results in an easy to retrieve way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I also developed a webapp and a website for the ease of lab scientists from non-technical backgrounds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The implementation code is propriety property of <a href="https://aganitha.ai/" target="_blank">Aganitha Cognitive Solutions</a>.</p>
